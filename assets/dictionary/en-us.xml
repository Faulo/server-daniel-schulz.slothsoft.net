			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambermoon" rel="external" target="_blank">Ambermoon</a>
				is a 1993 video game by Thalion Software which was released for the
				Amiga.
			</p>
			<p>It was one of the first games I've ever played and has kept a
				sweet spot in my heart ever since. It's an RPG where
				you start out
				as an InsertNameHere adventurer and recruit companions as you
				explore the game world, à la Baldur's Gate
				or Fallout. When I played
				it as a kid, it always bugged me that I couldn't change my party
				members' classes, names, or
				faces, and was instead at the mercy of
				what pre-defined characters already existed. Well, one day I poked
				around my
				savegames in a hex editor and realized that I could
				totally change these things.
			</p>
			<p>
				Long story short, I created an
				<a href="http://slothsoft.net/Ambermoon/SavegameEditor/" rel="next" target="_blank">online savegame editor</a>
				.

		<article>
			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				A few years ago I started learning Japanese, and along the way
				I've created some of tools to help me do so.
				One of
				those is a
				<a href="http://slothsoft.net/Japanese/Translator/" rel="next" target="_blank">Japanese-to-English Translator</a>
				.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the first things I noticed about Japanese is that, unlike
				Latin-based languages, it's not trivial to
				determine where a word
				ends and the next one begins (i.e., there's no "space" character). I
				found this makes using
				dictionaries to look up sentences incredibly
				frustrating, so I wrote a script that looks up every combination of
				adjacant characters (in an online dictionary) until a translation
				for every character sequence in a given sentence
				has been found.
				This worked well enough for my needs, so I kept adding more
				features, like audio recordings or a
				visual aid for drawing the
				characters.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h2>Technical Details</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Server-Side</dt>
				<dd>PHP receives the user input as JSON object, transcribed into
					Latin, Hiragana, and Katana. This is done because
					the search
					results of online dictionaries may vary depending on which of those
					3 encodings is searched for.
				</dd>
				<dd>
					The user input is looked up in the excellent dictionary
					<a href="http://jisho.org" rel="external" target="_blank">jisho.org</a>
					(There's no special API for this, I just parse the HTML via the
					usual
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/dom" />
					magic). If no result is found, the last character of user input is
					dropped (to be search separately later), and the
					process is
					repeated.
				</dd>
				<dd>
					When all characters have been looked up, every word found is looked
					up in the dictionary
					<a href="http://nihongo.monash.edu/cgi-bin/wwwjdic" rel="external" target="_blank">WWWJDIC</a>
					to get a link to an audio file.
				</dd>
				<dd>All requests made by the server are cached in a MySQL database,
					both to improve response time and to reduce the
					strain I put on the
					other dictionaries.
				</dd>
				<dd>The translations and audio links are then sent to the client as
					XML document.
				</dd>
				<dt>Client-Side</dt>
				<dd>The page itself is XHTML, served by my CMS.</dd>
				<dd>
					User input into the translator is transcribed every which way
					between Latin, Hiragana, and Katakana using an XML
					<a href="http://slothsoft.net/getResource.php/slothsoft/kana" rel="external" target="_blank">transcription table</a>
					. This happens in real-time, so the translator can function as a
					substitute Japanese keyboard, too.
				</dd>
				<dd>When user inaction is detected, the input is sent to the server
					to be processed as described above.
				</dd>
				<dd>
					The server response is converted to HTML via
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/xslt" />
					.

	<p key="LODB">E-Learning Specification, Viewer, Editor</p>
	<p key="LODB/content">
		<article>
			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				The
				<a href="https://tu-dresden.de" rel="external" target="_blank">Technische
					Universität Dresden
				</a>
				offers language courses, and they had contracted my then-place of
				employment,
				<a href="http://www.ibp-dresden.de/" rel="external" target="_blank">IBP
					Dresden
				</a>
				, with developing and maintaining an online e-learning tool. I was
				the project lead and main designer/programmer, so
				I wrote nearly all
				of its code, which I figure is a good enough reason to include it in
				my portfolio.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of the project was to create a website where students could
				log on and study languages in pre-defined
				<abbr title="dubbed &quot;Learning Objects&quot; in the spec">study units</abbr>
				; The material should consist of reading and listening
				comprehensions with a variety of different tasks for the
				student to
				solve, like multiple-choice questions and clozes. As this was
				supposed to be a language learning tool, it
				was important that the
				user interface supported multiple languages. Furthermore, the
				payload of each study unit should
				be able to contain image, video,
				and audio files. For the teachers, the tool should offer a
				WYSIWYG-style editor to
				create and maintain the study units, with a
				particular focus on an intuitive, yet flexible interface.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project consisted of 3 parts:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					To develop a data structure that could hold the information
					required by
					<abbr title="a.k.a., the frontend">the viewer</abbr>
					and
					<abbr title="a.k.a., the backend">the editor</abbr>
					. I quickly chose XML as host language and then developed an XML
					schema for it, both to make sure the XML produced
					by the editor
					doesn't deviate from the specification, and to give future
					implementers of the viewer or editor
					something to validate against.
				</li>
				<li>
					To develop a viewer for
					<abbr title="that is, the data file">the aforementioned XML</abbr>
					. In order to reduce traffic and increase responsiveness, I
					implemented it with very few server requests, in
					JavaScript. The
					main render routine is an XSL transformation, with an optional
					server round-trip for those browsers
					that lack support for native
					XSLT. Traffic only occurs, aside from the static resources, for the
					data file of each
					study unit (also its media files), and to log
					submitted answers for teacher review.
				</li>
				<li>
					To develop an editor that spits out data files for the viewer. This
					was, again, implemented almost entirely
					client-side in JavaScript,
					with server requests only done when needed to save or load the
					current unit. As there were
					a lot of user commands and data to
					handle, I implemented a Model-View-Controller sectioning to keep
					the code mostly
					tidy. To work around JavaScript's class inheritance
					wonkiness (this was before
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create"
						rel="external" target="_blank">Object.create</a>
					), I deployed a custom-made implementation of
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)" rel="external" target="_blank">Traits</a>
					.
				</li>
			</ul>

					<a href="http://schema.ibp-dresden.de/lodb/" rel="external" target="_blank">spec</a>
					, written as
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/xsd" />
					, describes the current state of development. Internally, it uses
					an
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/xslt" />
					to converts the schema into a neat
					<a href="http://schema.ibp-dresden.de/lodb/?page=documentation" rel="external" target="_blank">documentation</a>
					, and a schema parser (written in PHP) to create an
					<a href="http://schema.ibp-dresden.de/lodb/?page=dummy" rel="external" target="_blank">example XML</a>
					which contains 1 copy of just about every element possible and
					arranged so as to be a valid document according to
					the spec.

					The viewer is written in JavaScript and uses
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/xslt" />
					, with
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/xpath" />
					to access the interactive elements of the GUI. To do drag'n'drop it
					uses the HTML5
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/drag" />
					API. In order to support mobile, the
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/touch" />
					API was used, as well as
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/media-queries" />
					.
				</dd>
				<dt>Editor</dt>
				<dd>
					The editor uses the same code base as the viewer. Editing is done
					via the HTML5 attribute
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/contenteditable" />
					, and its related functions. The data file is manipulated via the
					usual
					<a data-dict-replace="spec/dom" />
					magic.

			<h2>Development Log</h2>
			<p>This section presents a playable version of every major milestone and some notes on which decisions went into
				making it.</p>
			<p>Note that a gamepad (preferably an Xbox-ish one) is required to play these.</p>
			<article>
				<h3>31.10.2020 - Milestone 7</h3>
				<p>For the final milestone, lots of polish was applied to the level design, the sound effects and the character
					controller.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/slothsoft@daniel-schulz.slothsoft.net/static/images/TheCursedBroom.v070"

			<article>
				<h3>03.10.2020 - Milestone 6</h3>
				<p>This milestone focused on improving the tilemap performance, polishing the particle systems, and adding the start
					of the 2nd level.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/slothsoft@daniel-schulz.slothsoft.net/static/images/TheCursedBroom.v060"
						alt="The Cursed Broom v0.6.0" />

						Completing the tutorial rewards you with some pretty flowers.

			<article>
				<h3>23.07.2020 - Milestone 5</h3>
				<p>Mechanically, we added a wall-jump and a dash, both available only while flying.</p>
				<p>Level design wise, we completed a draft of the tutorial level, and decided for the game structure to be about a
					vertical climb out of a cave and into the clouds.</p>

			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>18.06.2020 - Milestone 4</h3>
				<p>This milestone focused on making the ground/jump movement snappy, intuitive and fun.
					For this, the character controllers of Celeste's Madeline and Super Mario World's Mario were studied and approximated.
					Turns are now instant, even in mid-air, and there's some coyote time when walking off of platforms.</p>
				<p>There's also many more visuals and, finally, sound effects. And collectibles!</p>

			<article>
				<h3>04.06.2020 - Milestone 3</h3>
				<p>This milestone iterated the flight controls and tried to make the current avatar momentum matter a lot while
					mid-air.
					Sadly, the reliance on momentum made Maya very floaty.</p>
				<p>On the aesthetic side we added a lot of animations and visual effects, which improved game feel a lot!</p>

				<h3>28.05.2020 - Milestone 2</h3>
				<p>At this point Tina joined the project and brought a wonderful narration of a witch with a slightly malfunctioning
					broom.</p>
				<p>Gameplay introduced rotation during gliding, and a kinetic energy/potential energy translation similar to Mario's
					wing cap flight in Super Mario 64.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/slothsoft@daniel-schulz.slothsoft.net/static/images/TheCursedBroom.v020"

			<article>
				<h3>14.05.2020 - Milestone 1</h3>
				<p>The first prototype is the barest-bone implementation of a gliding ability. It's inspired by Knuckles' glide in
					Sonic 3 and Mario's dive jump in Super Mario 64.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/slothsoft@daniel-schulz.slothsoft.net/static/images/TheCursedBroom.v010"
						alt="The Cursed Broom v0.1.0" />
					<figcaption>
						In retrospect, binding both jump and glide to "any key" might have been a mistake (i.e., analog
						joystick to move).
